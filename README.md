# homework-template

This template was adapted from [https://github.com/jdavis/latex-homework-template](https://github.com/jdavis/latex-homework-template)

I use this template for Math 3345 at OSU because of its versatility in writing proofs. Optionally, a title page can be added by uncommenting line 153 of the template.

As this template evolves, I will update the README with documentation to make it useful for as many people as possible.
